# StableMarriageMatchAi

This Stable Matching implementation uses string inputs of men, women, and their respective rankings of each other to determine which pair of men and women would be optimal.

The Gale-Shapley algorithm was used as reference for the algorithm. 

Graphing modules were added in order to display bipartite graphs of men, women, and their matches after the algorithm is applied. 

Note: Matplotlib libraries are useful if the python script is running in an environment such as Jupyter Lab to allow for better plotting/visualization. This module is not necessary for other environments and should be commented or removed in order to run the script.
