# StableMarriageMatchAi

This Stable Matching implementation uses string inputs of men, women, and their respective rankings of each other to determine which pair of men and women would be optimal.

The Gale-Shapley algorithm was used as reference for the algorithm. 

Graphing modules were added in order to display bipartite graphs of men, women, and their matches after the algorithm is applied.
